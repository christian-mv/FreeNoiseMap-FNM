# FNM

Multi-platform free environmental noise modelling software targeting the main desktop and mobile operating systems as well as the web.

FNM is a piece of software developed in C++. An implementation for web is intended too although it might be limited by the suport of webassemebly in Qt. It is recommended to compile the source code in an operating system such as linux, windows, and mac. 


## FNM supports the following systems:

    Desktop OS:
        -linux
        -windows
        -macOS
    
    Mobile OS:
        -Android
        -iOS
    
    Web Browser:
        -Google Chrome
        -Mozilla FireFox 
        -Opera
        -safari
        -Microsoft Edge.
        



For the first stage of FNM, it is intended the standard ISO 9613 is intended to be implemented along with its user graphic interface. Integration with web map services such as google maps and openstreet maps is also part of the first stage of FNM.

For the second stage, the European calculation method CNOSSOS-EU will be targeted. Support for GIS and CAD files formats, i.e., DXF and SHP will be considered by integration with the GDAL library.

FNM also represent the results in a gradient color scale:
